            <h2>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To serve the downtrodden and to promote Tamil Language and Literature, Rajah Sir S. RM. Annamalai Chettiar founded Sri Minakshi College, Sri Minakshi Tamil College and Sri Minakshi Sanskrit College at Chidambaram in the early 1920s.  In 1928, Rajah Sir S. RM. Annamalai Chettiar agreed with the local Government to handover the above said institutions for establishing a University. Thus, on 01.01.1929 Annamalai University came into existence as the first-ever to have been founded by a private philanthropist. Ever since its establishment, Annamalai University has played an incredible role in the lives of the people near and far. Until 2013, the University was governed by the Annamalai University Act, 1928. In 2013, the Annamalai University Act, 2013 (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of 2013), was passed and has come into force from September 25, 2013. The University, which remained “unitary” in status until 2021, was made an “affiliating” one with Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Villuppuram, and Kallakurichi districts as its jurisdiction and 81 colleges are affiliated to the University now.</p>
